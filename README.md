# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site designed with a clean, superhero-style aesthetic.It not only highlight technical aspect but also the other creative skills that i did learnt with keen interest throughout college journey. It represents who I am, the work I've done, and how to reach out to me.

The UI layout, theme, and component structure were initially crafted with the help of **Lovable AI**, but a significant part of the final result came from my own contributions â€” especially in terms of **efficient prompting**, **tweaks**, and detailed refinements.

I chose to use AI in the early phase to simplify the time-consuming parts of UI/UX design, so I could stay focused on building my core projects. This approach allowed me to iterate faster and still maintain a personalized touch.The continous prompting and Lovable AIs quick simplification and suggestion made it possible to build it this fast.

The site is built using:
- **React** (with **TypeScript**) 
- **Vite** for fast builds
- **Supabase** for backend/database integration
